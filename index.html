<p>Intelligence is how people gauge how smart you are. If you get a score from 
85 to 115 you have normal IQ. With IQ tests they take 4 hours and cost $200, 
they are specificity designed to not be finished. When you take the test there
is a wide variety of questions like poetry riddles and more. Intelligence is 
based off many factors but never athletic ability.
